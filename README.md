# Desicion-Trees-and-Random-Forests-Using-python
Here I used a Kyphosis dataSet and used random forest algorithm to classify the Data. By using Decision trees i can able to achieve  only 68% accuracy since data set is small, we can improve it's Accuracy by implementing Algorithm using RandomForestClassifiers.
